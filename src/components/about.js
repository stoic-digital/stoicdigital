// Don’t get us wrong, we love the fact that technology is being pushed further,
but at the same time you don’t drive to work in a Formula 1 racing car.

At Stoic Digital, we don’t believe in loading bars and ostentatious design for the sake of it.
//
// We believe in simplicity and performance
//
//
// Are you sick of loading bars and slow websites? We are.
//
// I know what you’re thinking: this page loaded fast right?
//
// The web is exploding right now, but it has a bloat problem.
Plug-ins, dependencies, huge image files and gigantic video backgrounds,
that add megabytes to your site.
Every byte matters, and make it slow to load and slow to respond
//
// We leverage modern technologies to create simple experiences that provide
everything you do need, whilst including nothing you don’t.
Delivering lightweight sites and applications that won’t frustrate your users
with animated spinners and scrollbar highjacking.
//
// Read our blog post for more info on how we achieve this, including technical details for those
